    <h2>Quick Bio</h2>
    <p>I started my careeer as a sound engineer, but five years in Paris were enough to realise I was in the wrong place in the wrong industry, so I packed my bags and flew to Yukon Canada for a one-year working visa to train sled dogs üêæ, a childhood dream. While trying to figure out a new career path I started to sell my sound designer skills in the form of online products on third party sites. This went very well and got me started in affiliate marketing. I taught myself SEO, content marketing, and very quickly coding. Meanwhile, I went back to school and graduated a bachelor degree in business management. Soon after I started working for as a free-lancer for small to medium size e-commerce businesses.</p>
    <p>On my personal free time I enjoy lots of sports (kettlebells, circuit training), and French literature.</p>
