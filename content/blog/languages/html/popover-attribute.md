This new attribute is available cross-platform now, and is handy for a few UI web elements like modals, pop-ups, tool tips, etc...

Using the `popover` attribute is really simple. Add the attribute and an id to your target element, add the `popovertarget` to your trigger element, and you're on a roll.

There are a few interesting things to keep in mind : 

- when a `popover` element is active, it's in the **top-layer**, no need to worry about `z-index` anymore üí™
- the `popover` attribute can have a value of `auto` (default) or `manual`
- styling the background of an opened `popover` element is done through applying styles to `::backdrop` 
- baked in **ESC** key listening to hide the popover üëç
- baked in **light-dismiss**, meaning clicking outside the target will hide the popover element and return focus üëç

In the below pen are the differences between `auto` and `manual`.

## Popover on dialog elements

What really got me excited when I first started playing with the `popover` attribute is that I no longer had to handle the _closing_ myself. So I immediately thought about using it on a `dialog` element, that could save a few lines of code each time!

As I quickly found out, there is a caveat. `popover` does not inert the rest of the page like regular `dialog.showModal()` does. And that is a deal braker since in most cases, `dialog` are meant to force the focus on their content and inert the rest of the DOM.

Still, a nice tool to have in a dev toolbelt!
